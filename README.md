# RAG_-Application_in_Python
As a part of AI ML course in UT Austin, completed this project

**Objective**

Develop a RAG application to help business analysts efficiently extract key insights from extensive reports, such as How Apple is Organized for Innovation, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

"Apple HBR Report Document Q&A"
==============================
**_Problem Statement ::_**

**Business Context**

As organizations grow and scale, they are often inundated with large volumes of data, reports, and documents that contain critical information for decision-making. In real-world business settings, such as venture capital firms like Andreesen Horowitz, business analysts are required to sift through large datasets, research papers, or reports to extract relevant information that impacts strategic decisions.

For instance, consider that you've just joined Andreesen Horowitz, a renowned venture capital firm, and you are tasked with analyzing a dense report like the Harvard Business Review's "How Apple is Organized for Innovation." Going through the report manually can be extremely time-consuming as the size and complexity of these report increases. However, by using Semantic Search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, you can significantly streamline this process.

Imagine having the capability to directly ask questions like, “How does Apple structure its teams for innovation?” and get immediate, relevant answers drawn from the report. This ability to extract and organize specific insights quickly and accurately enables you to focus on higher-level analysis and decision-making, rather than being bogged down by information retrieval.
